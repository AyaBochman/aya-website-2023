## My New Personal Website for 2023 🎉

Created with Next.js (app router), React, TS and tailwind css

Hey there, I'm Aya! I'm a full stack web dev and a design enthusiast 🙃
It's been 2 years since I upgraded my personal website. 
I've learned a lot since then and decided it's time to utilize my new knowledge and make this little side project.
Have fun and see you around 🚀
